# Introduction

We knew the fundamentals of exploratory and manual functional testing before starting this lab. We knew that exploratory testing entails evaluating a system without pre-written test cases, enabling testers to actively investigate and find flaws using their knowledge and instincts. Manual scripted testing, on the other hand, is a structured approach in which the testing procedure is guided by pre-established test cases. However, we had little practical experience using these strategies in a real-world setting, and the majority of our knowledge was theoretical. Through real-world application, this lab gave us the chance to expand our understanding.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

For our exploratory testing, we aimed to cover a broad range of functionalities within the ATM system while also attempting edge cases that could reveal potential defects. Our plan included the following steps:

    1. Identify Key Functions: Focus on core operations such as login, withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, and fund transfers.
    2. Vary Input Scenarios: Use valid and invalid card numbers, incorrect PIN entries, and extreme values for deposits and withdrawals.
    3. Error Handling Verification: Check how the system responds to invalid transactions, multiple failed login attempts, and system restarts.
    4. Consistency Checks: Ensure the correct updating of balances after transactions and verify if the system maintains state correctly.
    5. Usability Assessment: Identify any UI/UX issues that could hinder user interaction or cause confusion.

With this method, we were able to investigate the ATM system methodically while still allowing for intuitive testing in response to unanticipated system behavior.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

We separated our efforts into two roles in order to manage pair testing efficiently: one person performed the tests as the tester, while the other person recorded results and examined flaws. Two pairs were formed from our four-person group, and each pair worked on separate test cases. We combined our findings after finishing our separate studies to provide an extensive defect report. Effective lab collaboration and comprehensive testing coverage were guaranteed by this division of work.
