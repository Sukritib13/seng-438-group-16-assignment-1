-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

After each pair finished their work, comparisson was relatively easy. Each side was able to find unique defects along with defects both sides found. Reports were well doccumented having relevent sections for each bug such as Steps to reproduce and initial state. Agreeance on report catagorizing made each testing type easy to identify to avoid double reporting as well.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned


Lessons learned:
Communication is important as we couldn't get as much done without knowing what had been finished yet. Once we started communicating to each other we were able to finish the work with relative ease.

Splitting work amongst ourselves was essential for the group to make progress without over-working any teammates. With each teammate having a relatively smaller workload, stress was minimized for all of us.
